# World Models
This repository contains a collection of work in order to implement a system as described in [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io).
The complete system will later be evaluated on different sets of environments.

## List of Contents

1. **VAE_MNIST**: implementation of a simple Variational AutoEncoder[1] using TF and tested on the MNIST dataset.
2. **LSTM_XOR**: use an LSTM rnn [2] to compute the XOR of a fixed/variable length sequence of bits
