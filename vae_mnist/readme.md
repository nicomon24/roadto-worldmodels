# VAE MNIST
This folder contains a notebook in which we train a Variational AutoEncoder[1] on the MNIST dataset.
Keep in mind that, for computational costs, we only train on a subset of the MNIST dataset. Also we did not tune any of the parameter of the training process.

So, take this work as a proof of concept and basic implementation.
